# ImageClassification
### Author: Akshat Phumbhra
Deep Learning Project on Image Classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32\*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32\*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

- Airplane
- Car
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The dataset can be found at - https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
